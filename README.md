Hello Everyone,

This website is a very important test for me to learn coding and progress on coding.I've tried coding for many times and I gave up when the hard assignments come.Now its time to break the chain!

In this website I am gonna show you what is the HTML boilerplate with all the title and charset.
Than you will see the Headings, pharagraphes, anchor texts and links connected with these.These can be absolute and relative links.

Finally you will see the image tags.Also while doing that ill correctly commit to github like atomic commits and you can analyze the everystep of the webpage from there.

Thank you!
