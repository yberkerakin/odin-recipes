    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Slightly sweet, this is one of the best soups I've had in a while.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>½ butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>½ cube chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground allspice</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
            <p>Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat; cook the onion, garlic, and thyme in the hot butter until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Add the squash and chicken stock; bring to a simmer and cook until the squash is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Crumble the bouillon into the soup; season with cumin, allspice, salt, and pepper; remove from heat.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
            <p>Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway. Hold the lid of the blender in place with a kitchen towel and carefully start the blender using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a serving bowl. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup in the pot.</p>
